# Boeken

This app is a simple draft for a books catalog app. You can add new books, for which the app pulls information from the [GoodReads.com](https://www.goodreads.com) database by using the GoodReads'public API. In this demo the book data you add or change is stored in your browser (using the Dexie.js wrapper for indexedDB). Your book data is kept until your browsers cache is cleared.

The demo is only to explore what you can do with Angular. If you want to track your own books and reading list, you'd better do it by using GoodReads.com.
